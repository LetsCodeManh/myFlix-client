## My role and tasks

As the sole developer of this project, I took on the role of designing and building the application from scratch. I faced the challenge of learning a new framework (React) and integrating it with Bootstrap, as well as working with a new library (Redux).

I learned a lot about React and Bootstrap, as well as working with other dependcies, during this project. I also gained a better understanding of how to integrate different technologies to build a functional and visually appealing application.
